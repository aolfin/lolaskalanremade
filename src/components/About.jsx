          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            Lola's Kalan Bistro was founded in 2002 by Sophia Reyes, who brought her family's cherished Filipino recipes from the Province region of Manila to our community. What began as a small family gathering place with just 6 tables has flourished into a beloved neighborhood staple, known for authentic home-cooked Filipino cuisine.
          </p>
          <p>
            This restaurant is named after Sophia's grandmother, the one who taught Sophia these secret recipes. It is inspired by the traditional Filipino stove called "kalan," our restaurant honors the generations of family cooking wisdom. Every dish on our menu is a recipe passed down through generations, served with the same love that Lola used to prepare meals for her family.
